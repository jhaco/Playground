# Playground

###### A 1.15.1 Fabric ModLoader port of features and items from older Minecraft mods.
###### The Playground is my personal [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod learning & development testing ground for Minecraft version 1.15.1. I will be using a pre-existing [project](https://github.com/fabric-community/the-hallow) by The Fabric Community as a template for organizing the project's components.

#### Progress:

|Mod|Progress|Task Update|
|---|--------|------|
|[Wearable Backpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wearable-backpacks)|20%|Successfully registered and rendered the backpack as a normal, non-functional in-game block and item. You can place, break, craft and drop it.|

#### Setup:
* Install a preferred IDE and a Java Development Kit (JDK) for Java 8 or Java 11: https://adoptopenjdk.net/.
* Fabric mod development environment setup instructions can be found here: https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup.
###### Personal note: the onsite tutorials are helpful but also outdated and scuffed. I might consider writing my own guide and posting on Github Pages to document my journey.

Version 1.0:
> Refactored code into separate responsible packages to be initialized by main. \
> Registered/rendered the backpack as a non-functional, but craftable block. It's a blue backpack! \
> Initial Fabric mod environment setup.
